<P>This method is used to read a JPEG Image from a user defined resource bound into the program (identified by the ResName) and load it into the specified Picture. Although the same can be achieved by loading a JPEG into (e.g. a TImage) at design time, the image will then be saved (as a resource) and bound into the .exe as a much larger bitmap. Separately providing the JPEG image as a user defined resource and loading it at run-time can reduced significantly the size of the final .exe. </P>
