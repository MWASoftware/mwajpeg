<P>Progressive JPEG rearranges the stored data into a series of scans of increasing quality.  In situations where a JPEG file is transmitted across a slow communications link, a decoder can generate a low-quality image very quickly from the first scan, then gradually improve the displayed quality as more scans are received.  The final image after all scans are complete is identical to that of a regular (sequential) JPEG file of the same quality setting.  Progressive JPEG files are often slightly smaller than equivalent sequential JPEG files, but the possibility of incremental display is the main reason for using progressive JPEG.</P>

<P>When this property is set to true a progressive JPEG file is generated using a default scan script generated by the JPEG library.</P>
