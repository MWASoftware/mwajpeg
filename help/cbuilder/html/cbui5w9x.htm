<H1><A NAME="topic_jpegresource"></A>How to make a JPEG Image into a user defined resource</H1>

<P>The methods <A HREF="cbui4rol.htm">LoadPictureFromResource</A> and <A HREF="cbui4j38.htm">LoadPictureFromResID</A> provide ways of loading a JPEG Image at run time into a TPicture from a user defined resource. (An example is provided by the Viewer Demo program’s about box).</P>

<P>Such a resource is simply binary data linked into the same .exe file as the program and accessed at run-time by either a name or a numeric identifier. It is created using the command line tool BRCC32.EXE - although the use of this tool is fortunately automated through the Project Manager and the project’s make file.</P>

<P>To create such a resource, you must first create a text file (you may use any available text editor such as Notepad), containing a line for each image that you want to make into a resource. This line will be in the form:</P>

<p class="code">&lt;name&gt; JPEG DISCARDABLE &lt;jpegfilename&gt;</p>

<P>The &lt;name&gt; can be any unique string (that is if you bind in multiple JPEG images, each must have a different name), and the &lt;jpegfilename&gt; is simply the filename and path (including extension) of the file containing the JPEG Image. Alternatively, &lt;name&gt; can be a unique number (&gt; 256).</P>

<P>For example, if the JPEG Image is in the file “MyImage.jpg” (in the current directory) and you decide to name it “MyPhoto”. Then this line will read:</P>

<p class="code">MyPhoto JPEG DISCARDABLE MyImage.jpg</p>

<P>Save this text file in the same directory as the project .cpp files and give it a name with the extension “.rc” (e.g. “MyPhoto.rc”). This .rc file should now be “added” to your project using the IDE’s Project Manager (remember to change the “File Type” to Resource Files (*.rc) in the Open Dialog!). The .rc file is otherwise added to your project in the same way that you would add a .cpp file.</P>

<P>All you have to do now is to compile your program and load the resource!</P>
