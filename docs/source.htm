<h1  align=center ><b>MWA JPEG Component Library</b></h1>
<hr>
<p >&nbsp;This folder contains the complete source code for the 
  MWA JPEG Component Library and build scripts.</p>
<p >The 
  file <em>build.bat</em> should be used to build the component library from source. 
  The first few lines of this script are configurable and specify the paths to 
  the versions of Delphi and C++Builder installed on your system. By default, 
  they are set to typical installation paths. However, you may need to edit them 
  if your installation differs from this. You may ignore the paths to versions 
  of Delphi and C++Builder not installed on your system.</p>
<p >Once 
  Build.bat has completed, you should have two new folders in the source code 
  folder. &quot;Packages&quot; contains the Delphi and C++Builder design and runtime 
  packages for the JPEG Component Library while, the &quot;units&quot; folder 
  contains the .dcu and for C++Builder, the .obj and .hpp files. In each folder, 
  a sub-folder will have been created for each version of Delphi and C++Builder 
  installed on your system and the compiled files placed there.</p>
<p >The 
  package names and subfolder names are as follows:</p>

<h2 >Installation of Old Versions</h2>
