MWA JPEG Component Library - Building the Packages

The scripts used to build the JPEG Component Library are also included in this distribution. You
will not have to use these scripts if your only interest is to compile and use the MWA JPEG
Component Library. They are used to compile and build the shareware and registered user version
installation packages.

* build-full-version.bat is used to build the registered user version of the software and is
  usually run first.

* build-evaluation-units.bat is used to build the evaluation (shareware) version of the software.

* deploy.bat is used to generate the Windows Installer packages using the WIX toolset  
  (https://www.firegiant.com/wixtoolset/).

Both WIX and thr 7-zip compression utility are required dependencies for building the installation
packages.

The "setConfig.bat" script is not usually called directly. It is used to set configuration variables
and paths to the installed versions of Delphi and C++Builder, and other utilities. 

Before running these scripts you must also build the "buildno" and "updttext" utilities found in the tools
subdirectory.
